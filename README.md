The PhotoLabs project for the Web Development React course programming.

# Photolabs

PhotoLabs is a SPA that allows users to like photos, click on an image to open a modal that shows the full image, details and similar photos, and browse photos by topic. When a photo has been liked from anywhere in the app, a notification is displayed in the navigation bar.
